The purpose of this is to track usage and purchases of certain things.
For example:
    How often do I have to buy paper towels?
    How often do I have to empty the litter box?
    How often do I really add oil to the car?
    How many uses do I realistically get out of this ____?

That could eventually get translated into,
    Do I need to buy more ___
    How long until I need to buy more ___
    How can I cut down on my ___ usage (or increase)
    Should I ____ more/less often?

Two basic types of things to consider: Exhaustive objects, and repeating tasks
    - You buy a bag of pet food, you use it a certain number of times, and run out. You buy another bag, and repeat.
    - You clean the bathroom, but the bathroom doesn't get replaced or used up, and you'll clean up the same one later on


So, we need to be able to:
    * Define a thing.
    * Mark it as at least one of:
        * A recurring purchase (e.g. bread)
        * A recurring task (e.g. doing the dishes)
        * A recurring use (e.g. detergent)
    * Set a date of:
        * Purchase
        * Initial usage (e.g. bought a 3-pack, want to mark when you started using the 2nd bag)
        * Recurred usage
        * Exhaustion (e.g. used up the last of the detergent)
    * Maintain statistics for that thing:
        * Lifespan - days and uses
        *
    * Recur ownership (e.g. used up the paper towels, bought another set)
         * This would be another instance of an object, which maintains some stats of the parent, but has its own short-term stats
    * Hold other information for user's future usage
        * Historical price, purchase location
        * Size

Database model:
    * Users - Basic definition for the user
        - ID, Username, Password, Nickname
    * Definition - Declaration of the basic thing
        - ID, Name, [number of instances], [overall usage count], [tracked lifetime]
    * Instance -
        - ID, Start date, Exhaustion date, total size, [usage count], [lifespan], [used size]
    * Occurrence - Simply track a use of the item
        - ID, occurrence date, size used
